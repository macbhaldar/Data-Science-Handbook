## Logistic Regression
Logistic Regression is a Machine Learning classification algorithm that is used to predict the probability of a categorical dependent variable. In logistic regression, the dependent variable is a binary variable that contains data coded as 1 (yes, success, etc.) or 0 (no, failure, etc.). In other words, the logistic regression model predicts P(Y=1) as a function of X.

### Logistic Regression Assumptions
- Binary logistic regression requires the dependent variable to be binary.
- For a binary regression, the factor level 1 of the dependent variable should represent the desired outcome.
- Only the meaningful variables should be included.
- The independent variables should be independent of each other. That is, the model should have little or no multicollinearity.
- The independent variables are linearly related to the log odds.
- Logistic regression requires quite large sample sizes.
